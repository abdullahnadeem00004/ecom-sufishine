2. Fill in test customer information
3. Click **Preview Email** to see how the email looks
4. Click **Send Test Email** to send a test email
5. Check the recipient's email inbox

### Manual Testing:

2. Complete the order successfully
3. Check the customer email address used in checkout
4. Verify the order confirmation email was received

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Email Not Configured Error**:

   - Check if `VITE_RESEND_API_KEY` is set in `.env` file
   - Restart development server after adding environment variable
   - Verify API key is correct and active

2. **Emails Not Being Sent**:

   - Check browser developer console for error messages
   - Verify Resend API key has sending permissions
   - Check Resend dashboard for send logs and errors

3. **Emails Going to Spam**:

   - Configure custom domain in Resend (recommended)
   - Set up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records
   - Use verified sender addresses

4. **Template Not Displaying Properly**:
   - Test email preview in admin panel
   - Check email client compatibility
   - Verify HTML template structure

### Development Notes:

- **Environment Variables**: Use `VITE_` prefix for client-side environment variables in Vite
- **Error Handling**: Email failures don't prevent order placement - orders still save successfully
- **Fallback System**: If primary email service fails, system logs error but continues operation
- **Security**: Never expose API keys in client-side code in production

- **100 emails/day**
- **10 emails/second**
